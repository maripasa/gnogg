# Description
Python script I made that reads videos of your libraries and adds them to your Backlogged account

# Dependencies
- shareX or other screen recording software (You'll need to reduce the screen recorded as much as possible, such only the text appears)
- tesseract (for ocr)
- python3

# Usage
1. setup your venv and install requirements (inside main folder):

   $ python3 -m venv venv ; source venv/bin/activate ; pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Use shareX to record your library
3. Place the video in the main folder
4. Add in the <remove.csv> the text you want to remove (Trash from the recording like "Install"
5. Add your Backlogged credentials to <credentials.json>
6. run gnogg:

   $ python3 gnogg.py <your_video>
